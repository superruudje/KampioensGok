What to do to update the site with new scores:

1. add `result` (array) with score after 90min to match object (schema.json).
2. add `result_nvl` (array) with final match score to match object (schema.json).
3. add `timeline` ([object]) to match object (schema.json).
    - type*: `goal` | `yellow` | `red`
    - minute*: minute of event
    - team*: team_id
    - player*: player {lastname,initial.}
    - direct: if type is red, set if direct red card or not

4. if knockout-fase teams are known, update poule.json. Add team_id to correct array.
5. if bonus question answer in known, update stores/content.js store -> bonus (array).
