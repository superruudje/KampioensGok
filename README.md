# üèÜ KampioensGok

KampioenPool is a web application that allows users to predict match results in a sports tournament. Each user submits score predictions per
match, and the app tracks and analyzes these predictions. It features live result entry, player-specific prediction tracking, and
statistical overviews of the most predicted outcomes per match.
